/**
 * This function will attach a scripting function (handler) to a console command, so that whenever a player or administrator uses the command the function is called.
 * Multiple command handlers can be attached to a single command, and they will be called in the order that the handlers were attached.
 * Equally, multiple commands can be handled by a single function, and the commandName parameter used to decide the course of action.
 * This can be triggered from the player's console or directly from the chat box by prefixing the message with a forward slash (/). For server side handlers, the server admin is also able to trigger these directly from the server's console in the same way as they are triggered from a player's console.
 * - Important note: Do NOT use the same name for your handler function as the command name, as this can lead to confusion if multiple handler functions are used. Use a name that describes your handler's purpose more specifically.
 * - Note: You cannot use "check", "list" or "test" as a command name.
 * @param commandName This is the name of the command you wish to attach a handler to. This is what must be typed into the console to trigger the function.
 * @param handlerFunction This is the function that you want the command to trigger, which has to be defined before you add the handler. This function can take commandName parameter, followed by as many parameters as you expect after your command (see below). These are all optional.
 * @param [caseSensitive=true] Specifies if the command handler will ignore the case for this command name.
 * @returns Returns true if the command handler was added successfully, false otherwise.
 * @see https://wiki.mtasa.com/wiki/AddCommandHandler
