 * For clientside scripts you can perform 2 fade ins or fade outs in a row, but for serverside scripts you must use one then the other.
 * - Note: The speed of the effect depends directly on the current gamespeed.
 * @param fadeIn Should the camera be faded in or out? Pass true to fade the camera in, false to fade it out to a color.
 * @param [timeToFade=1] The number of seconds it should take to fade.
 * @param [red=0] The amount of red in the color that the camera fades out to (0 - 255). Not required for fading in.
 * @param [green=0] The amount of green in the color that the camera fades out to (0 - 255). Not required for fading in.
 * @param [blue=0] The amount of blue in the color that the camera fades out to (0 - 255). Not required for fading in.
